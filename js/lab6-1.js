/* Defining Table
Write a program that helps a user choose the correct foot wear for the dayâ€™s weather. Your HTML interface should use the <select> element to limit the input options, thus validating the user input at the interface level. You must use a selection structure introduced in this lesson.

INPUT: get weather by selection of options provided via drop-down
PROCESSING: match weather selection to footwear using "if" or "either if" sequence
OUTPUT: Display matched footwear in "Display Best Footwear" button

	let footwear;
		if (weather=="hot") {
			footwear = "Sandles";
