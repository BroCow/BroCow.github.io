                    Our whitewater river adventure begins at 9:00 am. It starts off with a peaceful float down a wide, calm 
                    section of the river surrounded by beautiful rocks and forrest. We encounter our first excitement within 30 minutes,
                    and the fun continues at various levels until our lunch break at 11:30 am. The adventure continues at 12:30 pm 
                    as we set in for the final leg of the river. For the next 2 hours we enjoy waters that are fast moving, barely moving,
                    and raging! Our adventure ends at approximately 2:30 pm where our welcoming committee is ready to receive you.
                </p>

                    are capable of adjusting the adventure appropriately. Safety gear and life jackets are always worn, but we do require
                    that all rafters are able to swim and are at least 12 years of age.
