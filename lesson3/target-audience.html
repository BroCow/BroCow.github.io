				<h2>Target Audience Description</h2>
				<p>
					The target audience consists of Idaho residents living in the towns of Preston, Soda Springs, and Fish Haven. 
					These towns are mainly populated by younger families with a modest household income. 
					A large part of the population consists of children under the age of 18 due to the amount of 
					families that live in these towns. The average family size is around 3.5 people per household.
				</p>
				<p>
					This demographic will likely be interested in how the weather will affect their outdoor 
					activities such as hiking, biking, picnics, and local sporting events. They will also want to be 
					informed of any weather that may impact school schedules. In the winter, residents of these towns 
					will want to know what the road conditions are for travel as well.
				</p>

				<h2>Two Personas</h2>
		
				<p>
					The two personas are below:
				</p>

				<ol>
					<li><strong>The Adams Family</strong></li>
					<img id="family_pic" src="images_lesson3/family_pic.jpg" alt="Family at beach">
					<p>
						The Adams family need to know how to dress their kids for school, 
						how to get them where they need to go, and how the kids schedules may be impacted by the weather. 
						They are also very active outdoors and want to know what the <q>weekend weather</q> will be like so 
						their activities can be planned accordingly.
					</p>
					<li><strong>Jack Carpenter</strong></li>  
					<img id="carpenter_pic" src="images_lesson3/carpenter_pic.jpg" alt="Carpenter on roof">
					<p>
						Jack is 31 years old and works in the construction industry. When Jack isn't working, 
						he enjoys jogging and mountain biking. In the winter, he likes to go snow skiing.
						Jack will use the site to determine how to plan his outdoor activities.
						Since Jack often works outdoors, he will need to know if the weather is going to affect
						his ability to do his job or get to work. 
					</p>
				</ol>

				<h2>Scenarios</h2>

					<li>Will this weekend be a good option for a camping trip?</li>
