		<h2>Target Audience Description</h2>
		<p>
			The target audience consists of Idaho residents of Preston, Soda Springs, and Fish Haven. 
			These towns are mainly populated by younger families with a modest household income. 
			A large part of the population consists of children under the age of 18 due to the amount of 
			families that live in these towns. The average family size is around 3.5 people per household.
		</p>
		<p>
			This demographic will likely be interested in how the weather will affect their outdoor 
			activities such as hiking, biking, picnics, and local sporting events. They will also want to be 
			informed of any weather that may impact school schedules. In the winter, residents of these towns 
			will want to know what the road conditions are for travel as well.
